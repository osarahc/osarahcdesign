                <h2>Lesson 6: Deliberate Practice Journal</h2>
        <h3>L6 Deliberate practice journal</h3>
                I spent about 2 hours this week for practicing.
                This week’s practice journal I worked a lot on my pages. 
                I still have yet to get 14 pages because I don’t know what to fill them with. 
                The one suggestion I received didn’t seem as though it would work. 
                I have about 10 pages I believe so now I just need to find 4 more.
                I also am not completely sure what counts for pages and what doesn’t. 
                I have been making sure my links work to other pages. 
                I also worked a lot on the video and audio files. 
                I figured out the audio files and tried it out on a few different browsers as well as my smart phone.
                The video converter is still a bit of a mystery to me and I have been having a lot of problems with my computer after trying to install the Miro converter so I have also been trying to find a free was to get that fixed now which has really slowed down my progress with testing videos as well as getting the rest of my homework done.  I was also trying to figure out the index.php file and the discussion board really helped with that after someone finally understood my problem. 
Here is an example of my code for the audio test file:

<h3>Audio Test Page</h3>
                <audio controls preload="none">

                    <source src="/images/soundtest.mp3">

                    <source src="/images/soundtest.ogg">

            <p>Your browser does not support HTML5 audio. You can 

<a href="/path/zipfile.zip" title="download a zipped MP3 file">download a zipped version</a>

of the file in MP3 format to listening on your own MP3 player by right-clicking the link and selecting "Save as...".

</p>

</audio>  
</main>         
                <footer>
             <?php include $_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT'].'/modules/footer.php'; ?>
        </footer>
        
    </body>
