        <h3>L4 Deliberate practice journal</h3>
        <p>
            I spent about 2 to 3 hours working on creating more pages as well as cleaning up my deliberate practice journal. 
            I made a main page with links to my deliberate practice journal entries rather than have them all together as I did before.  
            <br>The following are examples of what I did.</p><br> 
        <h3><a href="/assesments/deliberate-practice.php">Deliberate practice main page</a></h3>
        <p>I am having a lot of problems with the new pages that I created. They are showing up as error 404 pages. 
            Also now all of my text in all of my pages is a hyperlink to my contact page which is really weird and the contact page doesn't even work, it is a 404 error page.</p>
