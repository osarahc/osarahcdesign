        <p>
            I spent about 4 hours working on my pages for my work sub-page. 
            In particular I worked on collecting the work examples from all of my past files and picking out what pieces 
            demonstrated best my work.</p><br> 
        <h3><a href="/mainnav/graphicdesign.php">Example of my Graphic Design Page</a></h3>
        
        <p>I still have a ways to go with a lot of my other pages. 
            I am just getting very basic information into my pages mostly
            because I do not have a ton of content to fill 14 pages but I am doing my best.</p>
