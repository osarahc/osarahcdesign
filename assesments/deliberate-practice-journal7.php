        <h3>L7 Deliberate practice journal</h3>
        <p> This week I spent about 4 hours or more this week. I worked mostly on the 
            site requirements and understanding all of them and trying to get everything to work.
            Yesterday I went through every page individually and checked it in a validator and they all passed
            except for the page that had the video link on it because it said that I couldn't use a percentage sign for teh video. 
            I tried taking it out but then the video was very small so I just left it. Here is the page my video file is on:
          </p><br> 
          <h3><a href="/mainnav/photoshop.php">Video page which is my photoshop design page</a></h3>
        
        <p>I also worked on creating more pages. I really struggled with this but I think that I covered the requirements.</p>
