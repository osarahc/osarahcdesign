        <h3>L8 Deliberate practice journal</h3>
        <p> This week I maybe spent an hour practicing CSS. I honestly just couldn't do a whole lot one handed now that I have my new baby 
            who constantly needs to be fed or changed. When he finally went to sleep I worked a bit on CSS and tried to reaquaint myself with 
            the different syntaxes and rules. I really wanted to print out the power point to have as a reference but I wasn't able to. I did the first activity so far but because
            I can't figure out how to get my proofs page working I am just including a screen shot of what I did to practice.
