            I spent about 2 hours this week practicing and trying to figure out different types of links for HTML5. 
            I struggled a lot with linking computer file into a web site. With some reading online and reading in our HTML & CSS text book as well as receiving a lot of help from Bro. Horton and other classmates I was finally able to learn how to code in computer files. 
            Iâ€™m not sure where doing our assignment ends and practicing begins but they both require a lot of work and having the freedom to practice I feel I have a bit more time to really understand what we are expected to do in out assignments which translates into being able to do great things in the future. 
The examples are the Responsiveness examples that I linked to my site plan as well as creating a site diagram and linking that successfully as well through creating it in word and then just opening and saving it in Photoshop so that I could cut out the page backdrop and save it as a jpeg.
<br>The following are examples of what I did.<br> 
<img height="100" width="75" src="/Images/responsiveness_0001.jpg" alt="Handwriten picture of a tablet layout of website">
<img height="100" width="75" src="/Images/siteplandiagram.jpg" alt="Diagram of the site.">
