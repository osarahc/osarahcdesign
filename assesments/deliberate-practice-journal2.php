                <h2>Lesson 2: Deliberate Practice Journal</h2>
               <p>Time spent in practice that week: 3 plus hours
The topic(s) that you focused on for your practice: I spent a LOT of time trying to figure out Netbeans and Filezilla and trying to get everything to work. I also thought a lot about what content and what should be offered on my website including how I would set up my business as a Web Designer. 
An example of what you produced as a result of your practice. The example can be a part of the entry itself or a link to a proof that you produced as part of your practice. All examples should be web-based files (HTML pages, CSS documents attached to web pages, etc):

This website still brings up what Bro. Horton did but here is what appears in Netbeans:<br>
        <a href="/index.php" title="Home Page">Example</a>
    <br>

I haven’t been able to do the links because for some reason when I update the information in Netbeans that isn’t what appears, it seems that Bro. Horton’s file is still attached and therefore I can’t change it. 
Here are some thoughts I jotted down about my website to help me figure out the content as well as some of the questions that I received for the scenarios exercise:
1.  examples of websites you have designed (at least three would be nice and important)<br>
 	- Most previous work to later work
	Have it divided into web sites, visual media, and graphic designs
2.  pricing/costs Is it just one upfront cost?(annual fee or one time fee, extras, etc)
	Price will be negotiated depending on the job.
3.  how does it work: 
     a. will it be easy to use for us/our customers? 
	Talk about my philosophy for userability
     b. will it work for mobile phones? 
	I will design for mobile devices at an extra charge
     c. what software will you use?
	Talk about the programs I am fluent in
     d. how long will it take to create
	This would be according to the project but links to price because it may be done quicker with additional fee
