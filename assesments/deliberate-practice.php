                <h2>Deliberate Practice Plan:</h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>Where:</strong>
                    I will practice at my new desk that I just got so that when I sit down at my desk my brain knows that it is time to work.<br>  

<strong>When:</strong>
I will practice between noon and 5 when the complex is a little bit quieter and my husband isn’t around. I also will need to maybe redo the “when” part of this plan because I will need to work with my baby’s schedule when he comes in a few weeks.<br>

<strong>How:</strong>
From what I understand the practicing is to be done outside of the normal 9 to 12 hours of work according to this 3 credit class so I would like to be realistic as you ask us to be taking 9 credits and having my first baby so outside of class time I will dedicate 1 to 3 hours of additional practice a week.<br>

<strong>Who:</strong>
I think that initially I will look for feedback from classmates that have experience because that has been the most helpful to me in my last class because they already understand the assignment and they have the skills to be able to help me understand because they have already gone through learning these principles. My next option would be my husband because he will be the most accessible to me and he also has some friends that he can ask if he doesn’t understand as well.<br>
