                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I love design but that realization came after a lot of time trying different careers. 
                Working and studying in those different fields has only helped me with my understanding different fields
                so that I can better design in those industries.</p><br>
                <p>I am married and am pregnant with my first child. I grew up in many different states but spent the ost time 
                in Minnesota. I studied Interior Design at LDS Business College and finished there with my Associates Degree in 
                general studies. I served a church mission in Argentina which greatly effected my life and passion for culture and travel.After my mission I
                studied business management at Utah Valley University. I finally found my true calling in Web Design when attending 
                Brigham Young University and am currently working on my Web Design degree through their online program.</p>
